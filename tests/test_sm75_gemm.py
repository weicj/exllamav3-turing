"""
Numerical validation for the sm_75 (Turing) port.

The Turing path substitutes two mma.m16n8k8 for each mma.m16n8k16 and replaces cp.async with
synchronous shared-memory stores. Both are meant to be exact, not approximate, so these tests
compare the quantized GEMM against a dequantize-then-matmul reference computed by the same
extension. A correct k-split reproduces the reference to fp16 rounding; a wrong fragment
mapping (the realistic failure mode - half the k dimension dropped or double-counted) shows up
as a large relative error, not a small one.

Run on any device; on sm_80+ this is a regression test that the refactor changed nothing.
